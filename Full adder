fast lib refers to afast library
it is design to perform task quickly and efficiently
library (gpdk 045wc):-it specifies the library which is generic physical design kit and using 45nm TSMC version
Attributes lists:-To design a full adder circut,we are giving the list of attributes they are time unit:1ns,voltage unit:1v,current unit:1ma,pulling resistance:1k,leakage power unit:1nw,capacitive load unit(1of),
default power supply using is 1.32v
leakage power-unwnated subthreshold current in the transistor channel when the transistor channel when the transistor is turn off
default its operating condition is of fast
designing the adder circuit
area consider is 0 
leakage power is 1.09891
pins are of A,B,CI,CO
A and B are input pins
CI And CO are of sum and carry
The function for=((A B)+(B CI)+(CI A))
the function is the carry function
Related pin will be A for this
it also provides rise fall and direction
1nw is given to maintain the lifespan of the battery
delay templates are given as like index1 and index2
((A^B)^CI)
the above function refers to sum function
it also  operates each function using basic function
